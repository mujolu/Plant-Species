Step 3: Train the model

## Training Configuration

I trained the model using **40 epochs**, a **batch size of 16**, and a **learning rate of 0.001** to help it learn effectively from the images.

I chose 40 epochs so the model would have enough time to understand the patterns in the dataset without overtraining. A batch size of 16 allowed the model to process a small group of images at a time, which balanced accuracy and training speed. I set the learning rate to 0.001 to keep the learning process steady and controlled, allowing the model to improve without making large errors.

Overall, these settings helped me achieve good results for the image classification task.
